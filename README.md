- 👋 Hi! I’m @rafaelsampa
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science as a whole, focusing in java and C. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java and C languages at University. Moreover learning how to use python by my own to resolve mathematical formulas.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that enriches my knowledge, I often find fun in the process of learning something new, whatever it is.
